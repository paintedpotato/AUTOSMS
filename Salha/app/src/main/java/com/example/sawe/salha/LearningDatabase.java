    import database data = datasetOfSMSes.SMSInbox.history(); //here
    [Incoming Outgoing] = data;
    //Incoming will form a list/array, and outgoing as well.

    For every incoming there must be one outgoing e.g Incoming[1] = "hey, how are you?";
    (P.S. convert everything in the beginning of the code to small caps)
    Outgoing[1] = "good, and you?";

    And putting these strings of thought in an if-statement so that should the same message
    appear again, it can easily be dealt with
    {{{In the future compensate for dual responses e.g. scenearios where 2 different replies
    where given upon same incoming by creating a list of multiple replies, but also *THIS IS
    A LONG WAY OF DOING THIS* if 2 or more messages are sent upon receiving one..($project
    Creativity)}}}

    What if I just use NN..it will still need a huge dataset to learn
    and get trained with..plus the classifiers for language...
